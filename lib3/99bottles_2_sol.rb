  Lambdas is that they act like functions. Blocks and Procs have
  their uses. But neither of them behaves 100% like a real life 
  function. Lambdas do

%Q(This solution contains a Class Bottles that has a method song and calls some verses, corresponding 
    to the 99 to 0 verses of the song. Inside the verses method a verse is created from the class Verse.
    To implement this solution the author defines a set of defined verses in diferent lambdas stored as constants.
    So when a bottle is picked  the verse takes the number of bottles left and slects the correct lamda with its name. )
%Q) Pitfalls  " the verse_for method gets invoked for every verse of the song, and therefore, one
hundred instances of Verse will be created, each containing a verse number and the lambda that
corresponds to that number.")
